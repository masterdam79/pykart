pykart
======

!This is my first coding project!

This program collects your karting heats and laptimes, and can print some interesting statistics about it. 
It uses a simple sqlite3 database and is writen in Python 3.

The database file contains my personal test data for now. See the sql doc to know howto create an empty database.
